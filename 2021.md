# MMM 2021
Notes on the Mourne Mountain Marathon 2021

## Kit carried or worn
### Required individual kit
* Montane Surge Jacket - lighter one might have been ok
* Berghaus paclite waterproof trousers
* Bright yellow hat, silk gloves, buff
* Blue thermal top
* Alpkit running tights (worn)
* X-Talon 212 shoes (worn)
* Vango venom 200 sleeping bag + silk liner
* Petzl Actik core headtorch
* Kanpass thumb compass
* Whistle
* Suunto Ambit 3 peak watch
* Staedtler pen - get chinagraph pencil incase wet next year
* SOL survival bag
* Montane Ultra Tour 40 pack

### Required group kit
* Force Ten Nitro Lite 200 tent
* Alpkit Kraku stove, lighter
* Alpkit MytiPot 900
* MSR small gas canister
* First aid kit - remove extra stuff next year. Keep tape
* Mourne Map

Matthew carried most of the group kit, progressively more during the first day. 
We rebalanced the packs slightly on the second day.

### Extra items
* Thermarest NeoAir (shorter length borrowed from James Simon)
* Running shorts (for overnight)
* Map romer
* MMM technical tee (worn)

## Food
Probably about the right amount but not necessarily what I wanted to eat.
Maybe add slightly more chocolate/haribo/jelly babies next year. Mix of items was good.
If the courses had been much longer then might not have had enough food. Sometimes, the winning time
on the elite is about 2 hours longer. 

* 2 Clif bars - Chocolate almond fudge
* 3 Clif bars - Hazelnut butter
* 2 Aldi caramel crunch bars
* 2 Titan bars
* 2 SportsBeans
* 2 packets hoola hoops
* 2 tea bags
* 1 Adventure food pasta carbonara
* 1 Cinnamon raisin porridge
* 1 Almond finger sponge cake bar (dessert)

I took some High5 Zero rehydration tablets which I managed to lose on the first day. Need to put in better
place in the rucksack next year.

I took a packet of jelly babies to NI but then decided they were surplus to requirements. In retrospect, some more
sweet items would have been good.

Matthew fed me some salted nuts on the first day when I was getting cramp. 

### Remaining food
* 1 Titan bar
* 1 Clif bar

## Notes
If forecast is cold, add second thermal as extra layer. Thermal wasn't worn during day and was only used at campsite
